Some server-side rendering advantages include:

- A server-side rendered application enables pages to load faster, improving the user experience.
- When rendering server-side, search engines can easily index and crawl content because
  the content can be rendered before the page is loaded, which is ideal for SEO. 
- Webpages are correctly indexed because web browsers prioritize web pages with faster load times.
- Rendering server-side helps efficiently load webpages for users with slow internet connection or outdated devices.


Server-side rendering disadvantages may include:

- Rendering server-side can be costly and resource-intensive as it is not the default for JavaScript websites,
  and the server takes on the full burden of rendering content for users and bots.
- While rendering static HTML server-side is efficient, rendering bigger, more complex applications
  server-side can increase load times due to the bottleneck.
- Server-side rendering may not be compatible with third-party JavaScript code. 
- Rendering server-side may be ideal for static site generation, but frequent server requests and
  full page reloads can result in overall slower page rendering in more complex applications.
