State
It alters the behavior of an object when its internal state changes.

According to Wikipedia

The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is close to the concept of finite-state machines.

Example
We will be taking an example of a light switch in which if we turn on or off the switch, its state changes.
