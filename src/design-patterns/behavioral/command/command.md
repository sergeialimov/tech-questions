Command
It creates objects which encapsulate actions in objects.

According to Wikipedia

In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.

Example
We will be taking a simple example of a bank account in which we give a command if we have to deposit or withdraw a certain amount of money.
