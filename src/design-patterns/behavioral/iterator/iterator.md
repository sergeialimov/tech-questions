Iterator
Iterator accesses the elements of an object without exposing its underlying representation.

According to Wikipedia

In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the containerâ€™s elements.

Example
We will be taking an example of an array in which we print the values of an array and then by using an iterator we print its value backwords.
