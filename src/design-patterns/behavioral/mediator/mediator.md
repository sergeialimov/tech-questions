Mediator
The mediator pattern adds a third-party object to control the interaction between two objects. It allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.

According to Wikipedia

The mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the programâ€™s running behavior. In object-oriented programming, programs often consist of many classes.

Example
We will be using an example of a person using a chat room. Here, a chatroom acts as a mediator between two people communicating.
