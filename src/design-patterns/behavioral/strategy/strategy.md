Strategy
It allows one of the algorithms to be selected in certain situations.

According to Wikipedia

The strategy pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

Example
We will take an example in which we have a text processor that will display data based on strategy(HTML or Markdown).
