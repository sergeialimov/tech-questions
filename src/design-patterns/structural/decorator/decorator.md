Decorator
It dynamically adds or overrides the behavior of an object.

According to Wikipedia

The decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

Example
We will be taking the example of color and shapes. If we have to draw a circle we will create methods and will draw a circle. If we have to draw a red circle. Now the behavior is added to an object and the Decorator pattern will help me in that.




allows us to dynamically add functionality and behavior to an object without affecting the behavior of other existing objects within the same class.
