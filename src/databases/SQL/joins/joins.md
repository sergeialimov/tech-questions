whatâ€™s the difference between Inner, Left, Right, and Full join?

The diagram below illustrates how different types of joins work. 

(INNER) JOIN: returns only matching rows between both tables.

LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: returns all matching rows, and non-matching rows from the left table.

RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: returns all the matching rows, and non-matching rows from the right table.

FULL (OUTER) JOIN: returns all the rows from both left and right tables, including non-matching rows.
