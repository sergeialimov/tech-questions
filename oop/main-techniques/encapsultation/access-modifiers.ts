// public, private, protected, readonly


// public
// The default visibility of class members is public. A public member can be accessed anywhere:

// protected members are only visible to subclasses of the class they’re declared in.


// private is like protected, but doesn’t allow access to the member even from subclasses

// Fields may be prefixed with the readonly modifier.
// This prevents assignments to the field outside of the constructor.
