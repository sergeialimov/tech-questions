Open-Closed Principle
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Use and export interfaces in a way that lets you depend on them instead of concretions.
This exposes an api that is closed to modification and can be extended upon.
Using an interface to define the interaction of api as a abstract construct leads to low coupling.
